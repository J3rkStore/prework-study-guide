# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation was to use this project as guided learning on HTML, CSS, JS, and Git
This was built to become familiar with the above concepts and put them into practice for experience
Before building this webpage I lacked knowlege and experience on HTML, CSS, JS, and Git
In creating this webpage I learned a great number of things about HTML, CSS, JS, and Git. Some of which is documented on the front end of the website itself, but a lot of it is embeded in the code. I intend to refer back to these HTML, CSS, and JS files frequently for reference on future projects. The files in this repo can also be used as reference for anyone looking for examples of basic HTML, CSS, and JS layouts
